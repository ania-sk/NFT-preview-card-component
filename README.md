## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- I learned how to use the hover selector.

```css
a:hover {
    color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
}
```
Changes the color of "a" elements when you hover over them.



- I learned how to bring another image/icon to the screen after hovering over the first image using the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements in CSS.
